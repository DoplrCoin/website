## Vision 

* The vision of Doplr is that in the end the coins and tech will become invisible for the end-user. 
* We see that users want crypto to play with, but paying for it seems too much risk for most. 
* We see users create value in a social network and receive nothing back but fake internet karma points.
* Doplr will never promote itself as a blockchain dev company, we're not building the next gen blockchain, so let's not lie to the users.
* We will however develop services and ideas around the use of crypto, we will focus on social media tipping.
* The goal of Doplr is to provide value in the connection between users, internet services and the blockchain.
* When we see interesting developments in other chains that have proven their stability, we will port it back to the Doplr chain. The organisation sees itself more in the role of a curator of technology rather than running on the forefront of blockchain technology.
* From the vision of the curator we will develop a practical plan as an integrator of internet and blockchain technologies.
* We envision a multiverse of coins, where some coins have an ecosystem of plain plug-in  internet technology and provide a link to the 'classical' internet world. 
* There will be other blockchains providing arbitrage and interoperability between the hundreds of successful coins.
* Doplr will be more like a store af value, and edge-currency designed to be compatible with 3 generation blockchain protocols like polkadot, aion and the likes.


## Doplr Airdrop 

* Principle, get as much people as possible involved.
* Let's fight multiple accounts/scammers but not make it ruin the experience of the normal users.
* We want this to be a low effort coin, max 45mins of effort needed per week to qualify for a semi full airdrop.
* We need ways to uniquely identify users but without classical KYC.

### Classic returning airdrop
Basic concept: we give rewards to  
* Unique people, who stay in our channels, PoP proof of presence.
* People who refer and 


Based on 'presence' in social channels. We will never monitor the volume you type but we will check if you're online. People will **never** be paid for volume. 

**COnceptual: Calculation and numbers need work**

So for 100 timeunits in an airdrop. 
We check: 
* is user online in discord (0 - 100) $D
* is the user online in telegram (0 - 100) $T

Every airdrop:
* did the user make 1 post on bttalk with our sig (0/1) $BTT
* did the user make 1 reply in the official reddit airdrop thread (0/1) $RED
* ...


**this gives us a score, for example:**
`` ($D + $T) + (($D + $T)/10) * $BTT +  (($D + $T)/10) * $RED  ``
*(take sum of forum + telegram, add 10% if btt add another 10% if reddit )*

We take that score and make it a bit more heavy by the level of auth : 
* Mail (x1.1)
* Phone (x1.1)
* bttalk account (x1.1)
* reddit account (x1.1)

Then, there will be the ***ta-ta-dam*** special airdrop challenge. 

* You need to take a picture with your username / id / uuid / code. 
* We tell you what has to be on it, like a cup , a piece of fruit , a flower , a hand , a shoe, a spoon, a can of soda/beer.
* People submit that to a form. enter the id in txt and attach a photo. 
* the bot displays the ids and posts pics in the channel with :+1: and :-1:, users vote , get a little reward for that and pics get validated. 
*  we do some exif scraping as well to fight abuse
*  this will *add* a number to your score that is the median of all other scores. 

The we have a list of scores and we apply a ladder system to it.

But not with big fees for to 1% 

Conceptually: 
* top : 25 % : 1000 doplr
* next : 25 % : 800 doplr 
* next : 25 % : 250 doplr 
* next : 25 % : 50 doplr 



### Referrals

If users refer someone, this means someone else types **!setref @username** , he will get good compensation based on the amount of airdrop the person he referred to has recieved. This will be different from the next referrals.

### Reach out airdrop. 
* a big part of the funds will be reserved for other coins that will be reached out to.
* e choose a coin (dying or not), which community seems reacheable to us.
* We reserve an amount, we take a snapshot of the balances, we publish that list.
* If users want to claim their coins they will need to sign a message and dump that into a form somewhere.
* We will put a refferal get code in the link for the user who has spread the link, this code will be logged and the users who've referred users from the other community get a **good** reward.

## Finance
* We will not be fundraising btc to get on an exchange. Too much scamminess.
* Let's wait till we're big enough so exchanges will come to us.
* Even better: let's just wait for 3rd gen blockchains that can be used by our huge userbase.
* Investors put pressure on the project, and manipulate it to go a certain way. 
* No fundraising iso style, no '*donations*' (wich is actually selling), no airdrop immunity buying. 

### how will we run/pay the services? 
* distributed , we will set up a patreon account to pay for these small expenses. 
* People can set up to be part of the patreon for >2$/month and will recieve early updates and goodies, special discord rank, ... 
* We're aiming at 100$ month to pay for services, we can raise it with patreon I suppose. If not I can afford it. 

## Coin Specifics
* Pivx clone 
* staking reward / masternode reward / foundation reward. 
* Start with low market cap and take a lot of the rewards for the foundation in the beginning, these funds will mostly be used for airdrops.
* This will give a low count of coins and true scarcity, we will need to do the math ont his.
* With pivx there's fun stuff built in  
* example : Shekel is a fork of PIVX that forked Dash that forked Bitcoin, and they did it [in 17 commits](https://github.com/shekeltechnologies/JewNew/commits/master).
* drawback: I don't know shizzle about this.
* another drawback: seems hard to maintain transparancy as an org, with a privacy coin.
